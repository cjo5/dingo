- A module is either a single file or a package
- A package is a directory with the same name as the module + a file inside the directory named "package.lang"
- Packages can contain multiple files that are part of the same module. 
    - "package.lang" is declared as a module

    - If a file is found in a package, other than "package.lang", and declared as module, it's ignored and a warning is displayed.
