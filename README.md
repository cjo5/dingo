# Dingo

## Introduction

Dingo is a programming language inspired by C++, Go and Rust.
The goal is to create a system language with convenient syntax and features, while maintaining simple C interoperability without bindings. 

Currently only manual memory management is supported (C style) but later on the plan is to add support for an ownership model.

## Example
